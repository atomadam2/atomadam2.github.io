My research focuses on developing new cell biological and computational tools to understand the full spectrum of cellular responses to stress. Currently, I am a research associate working with Dr. Laura Nagy to develop and expand the use of sequencing technologies to understand the role of the immune system in alcohol-associated liver disease. Currently, I want to understand dysfunction in the immune system in alcohol-associated hepatitis patients, and the effect that has on immune surveillance. 

About Me
=====
For my doctoral dissertation in the lab of Dr. Kyle Cunningham, I studied phosphorylation events and morphological stages that regulate cell death in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and disease-causing <i>Candida</i> species in response to antifungals and mating. From this work, using a few complementary genetic screens, we identified [Pib2](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/full/10.1091/mbc.E15-08-0581?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) as a regulator of TORC1 signalling, separate from the canonical pathway.

For my first postdoctoral fellowship in Dr. [David Serre](https://www.igs.umaryland.edu/labs/serre/people/)â€™s lab, first at the Cleveland Clinic then at University of Maryland, I was the first to apply [RNA-sequencing technologies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07275-9) and computational analyses to understand <i>Plasmodium vivax biology</i> and its [response to antimalarials](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08312-z) directly from patient samples.
