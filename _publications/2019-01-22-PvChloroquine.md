Studies of Plasmodium vivax gene expression are complicated by the lack of in vitro culture system and the difficulties associated with studying clinical infections that often contain multiple clones and a mixture of parasite stages. Here, we characterize the transcriptomes of P. vivax parasites from 26 malaria patients. We show that most parasite mRNAs derive from trophozoites and that the asynchronicity of P. vivax infections is therefore unlikely to confound gene expression studies. Analyses of gametocyte genes reveal two distinct clusters of co-regulated genes, suggesting that male and female gametocytes are independently regulated. Finally, we analyze gene expression changes induced by chloroquine and show that this antimalarial drug efficiently eliminates most P. vivax parasite stages but, in contrast to P. falciparum, does not affect trophozoites.

Gametocyte genes in <i>P. vivax</i> had highly correlated expression corresponding to gametocytogenesis. In response to chloroquine, while a number of genes were differentially expressed, the total amount of <i>P. vivax</i> RNA, relative to host RNA, was down, indicative of death of <i>P. vivax</i> cells.
