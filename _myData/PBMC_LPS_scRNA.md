excerpt: 'PBMCs were isolated from 4 AH patients and 4 healthy controls. They were <i>ex vivo</i> challenged with 100pg/mL LPS for 24 hours to model endotoxemia experienced during alcohol consumption. This data was collected and analyzed while I was a postdoc with [Dr. Laura Nagy](https://www.lerner.ccf.org/immuno/nagy/)'
